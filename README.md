   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   yarn build
   # or
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Create distributable packages**

   # or
   npm run dist
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the app** - The SayaLens icon will appear in your macOS menu bar
2. **Grant permissions** - When first running, you'll be prompted to grant screen recording permissions:
   - Open **System Preferences** (or **System Settings** on macOS 13+)
   - Navigate to **Privacy & Security** → **Screen Recording**
   - Add and enable **SayaLens**
   - Restart the application

### Scanning QR Codes

1. Click the **SayaLens** icon in your menu bar
2. Select **"Scan QR"**
3. Drag to select the area containing the QR code
4. Release to scan - the result will be displayed in a modern React UI and copied to your clipboard

### Extracting Text (OCR)

1. Click the **SayaLens** icon in your menu bar
2. Select **"Capture Text"**
3. Drag to select the text area
4. Release to extract - the text will be displayed in a beautiful interface

### Multi-Display Support

SayaLens automatically detects which monitor you're actively using and provides seamless multi-display support:

- **Smart Display Detection**: The capture window automatically appears on the display where your mouse cursor is located
- **Accurate Screen Capture**: Captures content from the correct monitor, even with different resolutions and scaling factors
- **Consistent Window Positioning**: Result and about windows appear on the same display where you performed the capture
- **Cross-Monitor Compatibility**: Works perfectly with mixed display setups (different resolutions, orientations, and DPI settings)

**How it works:**
1. When you trigger a capture (via menu or keyboard shortcut), SayaLens detects your cursor position
2. The capture overlay appears on the active monitor
3. Screen capture is performed from the correct display with proper scaling
4. Result windows appear on the same monitor for a consistent workflow

### Keyboard Shortcuts

#### Global Shortcuts (work system-wide)
- **Cmd+Shift+1**: Start QR code scanning
- **Cmd+Shift+2**: Start text capture (OCR)

#### During Capture
- **Escape**: Cancel current selection
- **Drag & Release**: Select area and process

#### In Result Window
- **Click Copy**: Copy result to clipboard
- **Copy and Close**: Copy result and close the window
